## What is Productify?
Productify is a Chrome Extension that aims to increase the efficiency of an everyday user on the internet. In this modern age where internet addiction has become rampant, it is productify that comes to your rescue. The basic idea behind the extension is to provide users with a wholesome and productive browsing experience on the internet. This is done by providing the user with the tools to control what he/she views on the internet and various other features that will assist him/her in browsing productively. Productify allows the user to block websites that he considers to be distracting, moving it out of his way. Websites can be unblocked at user's discretion. Users can find the meaning, translation and pronunciation of text on a website by selecting and rigth clicking it. **Productify also comes with its own mobile app!** Users can save articles from a website and view it on their app (offline). Words searched for- by the user are stored into a personalised dictionary which is  made available on the mobile app. Simultaneously, Productify displays usage statistics (time spent on websites, number of articles saved, number of words searched for meaning,etc) of the user that will provide a measure of his productiveness.



### Tech


Productify uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [mongoDB] - 
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Productify itself is open source with a [public repository] on GitHub.
